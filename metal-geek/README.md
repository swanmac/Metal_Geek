# Welcome to Metal Geek

This website was designed to let all of the new and seasoned guitarist learn about the actual guitar rigs that their favorite guitarists are using. 

This, of course, includes a listing of all of their gear from guitars and pickups, to effect pedals and amplifiers. 

We even go into detail about the configuration setup that is involved as well as any special tuning.

We realize that is all about getting that tone and matching that sound. There are so many factors involved, not counting the individual technique, but matching up the guitar rig is a great start.
