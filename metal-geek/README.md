# Welcome to Metal Geek

## A Project by Greg Swan

This website was designed to allow all new and seasoned guitarists to learn about the actual guitar rigs that their favorite guitarists are or were using. 

This, of course, includes a listing of all of their gear from guitars and pickups, to effect pedals and amplifiers. 

We even go into detail about the configuration setup that is involved as well as any special guitar string tuning.

We realize that for musicians, it is all about getting that tone and matching that sound. There are so many factors involved, not counting the individual's technique, but matching up to the guitar rig is a great start.

Our plan is to provide simple navigation from our list of top lead guitar players, to their guitar rig model, and on to the rig details model which will go into more detail for each artist rig details setup.

This project is a full stack application, meaning we will have a front end (React) visible website and it will use a backend database (Django) to supply data for the front end website.

Our backend is on a separate repository, you can find the link here: (https://github.com/swanmac/metal-geek-back-end)

We started with three models, however we added one additional model "Gear" to handle the gear database.

The information for the database is being extracted and recreated from a now defuncted website through the use of an online tool that permits viewing of previous versions of websites.

### Website Instructions
- All operations begin in the navigation links at the top.
- To Access the Guitarist click on the Guitarists link in the nav.
- Once clicked you will be brought to the artist list.
- Select an artist to view their general information: Bio, Bands, Website, and photo.
- Select (or click on) that artist again and you will be brought to that artists rig details.
- Rig details include: Guitarist name, Guitars, Pedals, Amplifiers, Year of the Rig, and Photo of the Rig.
- Select (or click on) that Rig Details and you will be brought to the Rig Design Details.
- Rig Design Details include: Rig Description: a detailed description of how the rig is laid out. Tuning: any special tuning, guitar pickup details, string details, etc...
- Selecting the Rig Design Details again will bring you back to the Guitarists list to start over.
- The Gear Database can be accessed by clicking the link at the top in the nav.
- The Gear Database contains all of the instruments on a grid.
- You can select any instrument in the grid and you will be taken to that specific item.
- Once at that item you will have full CRUD on that item (Update or Delete)
- The last link in the nav is an ADD Gear where you can Add a new Item to the gear database.
- Clicking back to the Gear Database you can confirm that your CRUD eas performed correctly.

### Models

- Artist
- Artist Rig
- Rig Details
- Gear (Full CRUD)


### Technology Used

- React
- Python
- Django

### Additional Technology Used

- React Spring


### Technology Not Used in Class

- React-carousel-card-3d

### Challenges

- Adding Full CRUD to the front and backend

### Stretch Goals

Stretch goals for this project were accomplished by adding the musical instrument database model that is Full CRUD on the backend in Django and on the frontend in React.
